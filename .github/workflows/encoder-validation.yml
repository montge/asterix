# TEMPORARILY DISABLED
# This workflow has YAML syntax issues due to inline Python code blocks.
# The multiline Python strings break YAML parsing (block scalar indentation).
# TODO: Refactor inline Python code to external scripts in scripts/ directory
# See GitHub Issue tracking this: need to create external scripts for encoder tests
