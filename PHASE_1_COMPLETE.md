**Location:** `do-278/` directory

### 2. âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

Created `.github/workflows/ci-verification.yml` with:
- C++ builds (Make + CMake)
- Python testing across 5 versions (3.8-3.12)
- Integration tests
- Valgrind memory checks
- Static analysis (cppcheck, clang-tidy)
- Coverage reporting framework

**Status:** Pushed to GitHub, pipeline will run automatically

### 3. âœ… Test Infrastructure

- Created `tests/` directory structure
- Added Python test framework (pytest + coverage)
- Created 16 new tests in `tests/python/test_basic_parsing.py`
- **Total: 24 passing tests**

### 4. âœ… Baseline Coverage Measured

**Python Module:**
- **Overall Coverage: 39%**
- **Tests Passing: 24/24 (100%)**
- **Strongest Module:** `test_parse.py` at 99%
- **Core Module:** `__init__.py` at 53%

**C++ Integration:**
- **Tests Passing: 9/12 (75%)**
- **Functional Tests:** All passing
- **Known Issues:** 3 tests failing (filter, 2x valgrind)

### 5. âœ… Documentation Created

**Key Documents:**
1. `DO-278_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - **Your roadmap** (START HERE)
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Architecture reference
3. `do-278/README.md` - Quick reference
4. `do-278/verification/BASELINE_METRICS.md` - Full baseline report
5. `tests/README.md` - Testing guide

### 6. âœ… Git Commit & Push

All infrastructure committed and pushed to GitHub:
- Commit: `06bba98`
- Message: "Add DO-278A AL-3 compliance infrastructure"
- Files: 11 files changed, 2961 insertions(+)

## Baseline Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value | Target | Gap |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Python Coverage** | 39% | 90-95% | +51-56 pts |
| **Python Tests** | 24/24 âœ“ | All pass | Met âœ“ |
| **C++ Tests** | 9/12 | 12/12 | 3 to fix |
| **C++ Coverage** | Not yet measured | â‰¥85% | TBD |

## What's Next: Phase 2 - Requirements Documentation

### Week 1 Tasks:

1. **Document High-Level Requirements (HLR)**
   - Start with CAT048 (most common category)
   - Extract from EUROCONTROL ASTERIX specs
   - Use template in `do-278/requirements/Requirements_Template.md`

2. **Fix C++ Test Failures**
   ```bash
   cd src && make debug && make debug install
   cd ../install/test && ./test.sh
   ```

3. **Set Up C++ Coverage**
   - Modify Makefiles for `--coverage` flags
   - Measure baseline C++ coverage
   - Target: Understand starting point

4. **Improve Python Coverage**
   - Add tests for untested functions
   - Focus on `parse_with_offset()`, `describeXML()`
   - Target: 50-60% by end of week

## How to Get Started

### View the Baseline

```bash
# Open coverage report in browser
open htmlcov/index.html

# Or view in terminal
cat do-278/verification/BASELINE_METRICS.md
```

### Read the Implementation Guide

```bash
less DO-278_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
# or
cat DO-278_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

### Check CI/CD Pipeline

Visit: https://github.com/montge/asterix/actions

The pipeline should be running now!

### Run Tests Locally

```bash
# Activate venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run Python tests
pytest asterix/test/ tests/python/ -v --cov=asterix --cov-report=term

# Run C++ tests
cd install/test && ./test.sh

# Run all tests via make
cd src && make test
```

## Key Files Reference

**Start Here:**
- `DO-278_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete roadmap

**Documentation:**
- `do-278/README.md` - Quick reference
- `do-278/plans/Software_Verification_Plan.md` - Test strategy
- `do-278/verification/BASELINE_METRICS.md` - Baseline report

## Success Criteria Met âœ“

- [x] DO-278 structure created
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [x] Baseline coverage measured (39%)
- [x] Test infrastructure established

## GitHub Actions Status

Your CI pipeline is now running at:
**https://github.com/montge/asterix/actions**

It will:
1. Build C++ (Ubuntu, Make + CMake)
2. Test Python (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
3. Run integration tests
4. Check memory leaks (valgrind)
5. Run static analysis
6. Generate coverage reports

**Expected:** Some jobs may fail initially (that's OK!)
- C++ coverage not yet instrumented
- Some tests have known failures
- This is the baseline - we'll fix these in Phase 2

---

## Commands Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Activate Python environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests with coverage
pytest asterix/test/ tests/python/ --cov=asterix --cov-report=html

# View coverage
open htmlcov/index.html

# Build C++
cd src && make clean && make && make install

# Run C++ tests
cd install/test && ./test.sh

# Check git status
git status

# View commit
git log --oneline -1

# View all DO-278 files
find do-278 tests -type f
```

## Questions & Next Steps

**Ready for Phase 2?**

Phase 2 focuses on:
1. Documenting requirements from ASTERIX specs
2. Creating Requirements Traceability Matrix
3. Fixing known test failures
4. Adding C++ coverage measurement
5. Improving Python coverage to 50-60%

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks

**Would you like to:**
- A. Start documenting requirements for CAT048
- B. Fix the 3 failing C++ tests
- C. Set up C++ coverage instrumentation
- D. Improve Python test coverage
- E. Review the CI/CD pipeline results

**Your choice drives the next phase!**
