3. Formal methods verification
4. Complete DO-278A documentation

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. âœ… **Agent-driven development:** Autonomous agents created high-quality tests
2. âœ… **lcov HTML reports:** Essential for identifying exact uncovered lines
3. âœ… **Surgical targeting:** File-by-file approach more effective than broad tests
4. âœ… **Test pattern reuse:** Consistent patterns improved agent success rate
5. âœ… **Incremental measurement:** Frequent coverage checks kept progress visible

### Challenges Overcome
1. âœ… **Private function testing:** Learned to test through public APIs
2. âœ… **Global variables:** Solved extern vs definition issues
3. âœ… **Coverage measurement discrepancies:** Used multiple tools for validation
4. âœ… **Constructor requirements:** Learned ASTERIX object creation patterns
5. âœ… **Agent task scoping:** Refined prompts for better agent performance

### Best Practices Established
1. Always measure coverage with lcov before assuming
2. Use file-by-file HTML reports for precision
3. Test public APIs comprehensively (private functions follow)
4. Follow established test patterns for consistency
5. Agent tasks should be autonomous with clear success criteria
6. Commit frequently with descriptive messages

## Conclusion

This session represents a **major milestone** in the ASTERIX decoder project:

âœ… **60% coverage milestone exceeded** (achieved 63.1%)
âœ… **60 comprehensive test cases** added with 100% pass rate
âœ… **3 critically undertested files** brought to good coverage
âœ… **Agent-driven development** proven highly effective
âœ… **Clear roadmap** established for reaching 80% and beyond

The project is now **42% complete** toward Phase 2 (80% coverage) goal and has established a **strong foundation** for DO-278A AL-3 certification.

**Status:** Ready to continue toward 65-70% coverage using proven agent-driven methodology.
