Receive and parse ASTERIX data from UDP multicast streams.

This example demonstrates how to receive ASTERIX data transmitted over UDP
multicast networks. Multicast is commonly used in Air Traffic Management (ATM)
systems to distribute surveillance data from radar sensors to multiple
processing systems simultaneously.

Network Multicast Basics:
    - Multicast uses special IP addresses (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255)
    - Multiple receivers can join the same multicast group
    - Data sent to the group is received by all members
    - More efficient than sending individual copies to each receiver

This example:
    - Joins multicast group 232.1.1.11 on port 21111
    - Receives UDP packets containing ASTERIX data
    - Parses each packet and displays the results
    - Runs indefinitely (press Ctrl+C to stop)

Usage:
    python multicast_receive.py

    The script will run continuously, printing each received packet.
    Press Ctrl+C to stop.

Requirements:
    - asterix_decoder package installed (pip install asterix_decoder)
    - Network access to multicast group 232.1.1.11
    - Firewall rules allowing UDP port 21111
    - A multicast sender transmitting ASTERIX data

Example Output:
    1. Receiver received = [{'cat': 48, 'len': 48, 'records': [...]}]
    2. Receiver received = [{'cat': 48, 'len': 48, 'records': [...]}]
    3. Receiver received = [{'cat': 34, 'len': 26, 'records': [...]}]
    ...

Network Configuration:
    Multicast Group: 232.1.1.11
    Port: 21111
    Protocol: UDP
    Interface: All interfaces (INADDR_ANY)

Security Notes:
    - This example binds to all network interfaces ('') as required for multicast
    - In production, consider:
      * Firewall rules to restrict access to port 21111
      * Running in isolated network segments for ATM traffic
      * Binding to specific interface IP if multicast is on known interface
      * Implementing application-level authentication

def setup_multicast_receiver(multicast_group, port):

    Configure and bind a socket for receiving multicast UDP packets.

    This function sets up a UDP socket with the necessary options for
    multicast reception:
    1. Creates a UDP socket
    2. Enables address reuse (allows multiple processes to bind same port)
    3. Binds to all interfaces on the specified port
    4. Joins the multicast group

    Args:
        multicast_group (str): Multicast IP address (e.g., "232.1.1.11")
            Must be in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
        port (int): UDP port number (e.g., 21111)

    Returns:
        socket.socket: Configured socket ready to receive multicast packets

    Raises:
        socket.error: If socket setup fails or multicast join fails
        OSError: If port is already in use without SO_REUSEADDR

    Example:
        >>> sock = setup_multicast_receiver("232.1.1.11", 21111)
        >>> data = sock.recv(10240)  # Receive up to 10KB
        >>> print(f"Received {len(data)} bytes")
        Received 48 bytes

    Note:
        The socket binds to '' (all interfaces) which is required for multicast
        to work correctly. This is a security consideration in production.

        Multicast IP Address Ranges:
        - 224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255: Reserved for local network control
        - 224.0.1.0 - 238.255.255.255: Globally scoped multicast
        - 239.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255: Administratively scoped (organization-local)
