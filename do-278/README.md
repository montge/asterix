## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Project

```bash
# C++ executable
cd src
make
make install
make test

# Python module
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
python -m unittest
```

### 2. Run Verification

```bash
# CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
git push  # Triggers CI automatically

# Local testing
cd install/test
./test.sh

# Memory check
./valgrind_test.sh
```

### 3. Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Python coverage
python -m pytest --cov=asterix --cov-report=html asterix/test/

# C++ coverage (TODO: needs instrumentation)
# See do-278/verification/ for reports
```

## Coverage Targets

- **Overall Project:** 90-95%
- **Per Module:** ≥80%
- **Critical Modules:** ≥90%

## Test-Driven Development Approach

We used a **retrofit TDD approach** for this existing codebase:

### Phase 1: Baseline ✅ Complete
- Build existing code
- Run existing tests
- Document current state
- **Result:** 39% coverage, 24 tests

### Phase 2: Requirements ✅ Complete
- Extract requirements from ASTERIX specs
- Document existing behavior
- Create traceability matrix
- **Result:** HLR, LLR, RTM documents complete

### Phase 3: Test Development ✅ Complete
- Write test cases for requirements
- Achieve module coverage targets (≥80%)
- Refactor for testability
- **Result:** 560 tests, 6+ modules ≥90%

### Phase 4: Coverage Achievement ✅ Complete
- Measure coverage
- Add tests for gaps
- Reach 90-95% overall coverage
- **Result:** 92.2% overall, 95.5% functions

### Phase 5: Documentation ✅ Complete
- Complete all verification records
- Conduct reviews
- Archive results
- **Result:** All DO-278A documentation complete

### Phase 6: Certification ⏳ In Progress
- Final design review
- Certification authority audit
- Production deployment

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflows:
- `.github/workflows/ci-verification.yml` - Main verification CI
- `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` - Security scanning
- `.github/workflows/python-publish.yml` - PyPI publishing

## Contributing

When making changes:

1. **Create requirement** - Document what you're adding in `do-278/requirements/`
2. **Write tests first** - Follow TDD approach
3. **Implement** - Write the code
4. **Verify coverage** - Ensure targets met
5. **Update traceability** - Link requirement → design → code → test
6. **Submit PR** - CI will verify
