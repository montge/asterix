# Software Accomplishment Summary (SAS)
## ASTERIX Decoder - DO-278A Compliance

**Document ID:** SAS-ASTERIX-001
**Revision:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Assurance Level:** AL-3 (Major)

---

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The ASTERIX Decoder is a software component for decoding and parsing EUROCONTROL ASTERIX (All Purpose STructured EUROCONTROL SuRveillance Information EXchange) protocol data used in CNS/ATM systems.

### 1.2 Application Domain
- **Type:** Ground-based CNS/ATM System Software
- **Function:** Surveillance data decoding and parsing
- **Standard:** DO-278A / ED-109
- **Assurance Level:** AL-3

### 1.3 Assurance Level Justification

**AL-3 (Major)** was selected because:
- Software processes critical surveillance data for Air Traffic Management
- Incorrect parsing could lead to erroneous track information
- Failure could impair controller efficiency and situational awareness
- System operates within ground-based ATM infrastructure with redundancy
- Errors are within operational capabilities to detect and manage

**Safety Impact:** Malfunction could cause incorrect surveillance data presentation, potentially leading to reduced safety margins in air traffic control operations.
